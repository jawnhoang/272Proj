                <p>
                    JH Kits' goal is to deliver imported model kits to you at a fair price!
                    <br><br>
                    Hobby stores will often inflate the prices for these model kits that feels too outrageous
                    for what the kit is actually worth! 
                    <br><br>
                    Here at JH Kits, our passion is on expanding our model building community without breaking the bank
                    for models of all types of grades.
